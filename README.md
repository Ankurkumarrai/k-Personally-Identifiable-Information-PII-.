## What technologies are used for this project?

This project is built with:

- Vite
- TypeScript
- React
- shadcn-ui
- Tailwind CSS


1. OCR Tools (Optical Character Recognition)
These tools extract text from images (like scanned documents or photos).

 Tesseract
An open-source OCR engine developed by HP and maintained by Google.

Works offline.

Supports over 100 languages.

Can recognize printed text and some handwriting.

Often used with pytesseract in Python.

Use case: Extracting text from scanned ID cards or forms.

 EasyOCR
A Python-based OCR library that supports 80+ languages.

Based on deep learning (PyTorch).

Easier to use than Tesseract for some languages and handwriting.

Can handle text in non-standard fonts or noisy images.

Use case: When you need fast setup and decent OCR performance for multiple languages or complex layouts.

 Google Cloud Vision OCR
A cloud-based OCR API by Google Cloud Platform.

Extremely powerful and accurate.

Supports handwritten text, printed text, tables, and forms.

Also provides metadata like bounding boxes and text confidence scores.

Use case: Production-grade OCR where high accuracy, language support, and scalability are crucial.

 2. PII Detection Libraries
These tools identify personally identifiable information (PII) like names, emails, phone numbers, etc., in text.

 Presidio (by Microsoft)
Open-source library for PII detection and redaction.

Built-in recognizers for phone numbers, SSNs, credit cards, etc.

Custom recognizers can be added using regex or NLP models.

Can also anonymize or mask PII.

Use case: Automatically redact PII from text documents or chat logs.

spaCy
NLP (Natural Language Processing) library in Python.

Pretrained models for entity recognition (NER) to detect names, locations, etc.

Can be extended with custom models to detect domain-specific PII.

Use case: NLP-based entity detection with customization flexibility.

 Regex-based filters
Use regular expressions to detect patterns (e.g., email: \w+@\w+\.\w+, phone: \d{10}).

Very fast, no dependency on external libraries.

Use case: When you need lightweight PII detection for well-defined formats.

 3. Image Masking Tools
These tools help in hiding or blurring sensitive information inside images.

 OpenCV
A powerful computer vision library in C++/Python.

Can blur, draw rectangles, or mask detected text areas.

Often used with OCR (e.g., detect text â†’ blur text).

Use case: Redacting text from images after OCR detects PII.

 PIL (Pillow)
Python Imaging Library (PIL) fork for image processing.

Can manipulate pixels, crop areas, and draw shapes over images.

Use case: Lightweight masking or editing for simple image redaction.

 4. LLMs or Cloud APIs for Intelligent Data Recognition
These tools use AI language models or cloud APIs to understand and process complex documents.

 LLMs (Large Language Models)
Examples: OpenAI's GPT, Claude, Gemini, LLaMA.

Can understand context and meaning of text (beyond pattern-matching).

Can classify, summarize, or detect PII with high accuracy using few-shot examples or prompts.

Use case: Contextual redaction, intelligent document parsing, or privacy-aware summarization.

 Cloud-based APIs
AWS Comprehend, Azure Text Analytics, Google Data Loss Prevention (DLP).

Detect PII, sentiment, and entities from unstructured data.

Useful for large-scale processing with compliance features.

Use case: Enterprise-level data protection and compliance workflows.
